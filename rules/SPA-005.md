**Rule ID:** SPA-005

**Description:** Traces do not contain a high number of short duration spans.

**Rationale:** An excessive number of very short-duration internal spans (`span.kind=INTERNAL`) within a trace might indicate excessive internal calls, instrumentation overhead, or potentially inefficient code. Identifying such traces can help optimize application performance and reduce unnecessary overhead.

**Target:** Span

**Criteria:** No more than 20 spans within a single trace have a \`duration\` less than 5 milliseconds.

**Impact:** Important
