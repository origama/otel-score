**Rule ID:** LOG-001

**Description:** Detects debug-level logs in the `production` environment first observed more than 14 days ago.

**Rationale:** Debug-level logging should generally not be enabled in production environments long-term. Retaining debug logs for extended periods in production can lead to increased storage costs, potential security concerns due to sensitive information being logged, and noisy logs that make troubleshooting more difficult. This rule helps identify situations where debug logging is left on inadvertently in production.

**Target:** Log

**Criteria:** A log record with `severity.text` \= `DEBUG` is observed in an environment where the resource attribute `deployment.environment.name` indicates a production deployment and was first observed more than 14 days ago.

**Severity:** Important

**Type:** Negative
