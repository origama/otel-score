**Rule ID:** SPA-003

**Description:** Span names have bound cardinality. 

**Rationale:** HTTP and Database span names, depending on the instrumentation, can be high cardinality due to literals embedded in database queries, or literal URL paths instead of HTTP routes.

High-cardinality span names impact the usefulness of group-by mechanics, reduce the effectiveness of filtering mechanics, and can blow up indexes in tools that rely on them.
